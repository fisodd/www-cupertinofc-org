+++

Cupertino FC has two kinds of coaches working with our teams.

+ We have trainers we hire to develop skills and techniques,
  and to help our teams appreciate strategies that can help them win games.

+ We also have volunteers from our community of families
  who step up to help their team;
  they help their players improve
  and help them be prepared for the challenges they will face.

Expectations
------------

Whether paid or volunteer,
when it comes to dealing with players
we have similar expectations.

* We expect our coaches to develop our teams as far as they will go.

* We expect our coaches to put the team's needs ahead of any single player.

* We expect our coaches to teach through positive coaching.

* We expect our coaches to preach good sportsmanship and to lead by example.
