Expectations
------------

The leaders of Cupertino FC are involved in this club
to enable as much good soccer as we can for our local youth.

We strive to provide a great experience with solid training
for every team in our club.
We grow good leaders from the families involved to manage the team,
we recruit effective trainers to develop each team,
we scout opportunities for our teams to compete.

Our goal is to provide each team with the right opportunities
to be challenged and to be successful meeting those challenges.
We aim for each team to have a winning season,
but a season of where a team wins most ever game
is a season where we missed an opportunity
to give that team a better challenge.


Structure
---------

Cupertino FC is a small club,
and we have a small board -- with lots of room to add volunteers.

The base mechanics of keeping the club running is managed
by our "Table Of Admins"
including
our president,
our directors of coaching,
our soccer administrator,
our operations administrator,
and our finance adminstrator.

Underneath the admins we have a wide team of volunteers,
with roles large and small.
Contact us and our admins will find a role for everyone.
