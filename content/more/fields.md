Cupertino FC uses a variety of fields all around Cupertino
and the nearby cities.

For practice fields we mostly use fields
at the local elementary and middle schools,
commonly
[Kennedy Middle School](https://www.cusdk8.org/kennedy),
[Lincoln Elementary](https://www.cusdk8.org/lincoln),
and
[Eaton Elementary](https://www.cusdk8.org/eaton).

For our home games, we utilize a variety of the better local fields.
The "Track" fields at Kennedy
are where we host many of our 7v7 and 9v9 games.
For 11v11 games we commonly use the field at Eaton.
However, depending upon availability,
we may also use Lincoln Elementary
and Hoover Park and Creekside Park,
as well as share some of the fields
with our neighbors in Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and San Jose.

Our fields are a scarce resource.
Please treat them well,
and always follow any posted rules,
especially be mindful of when the fields are closed due to weather.

All of the fields we use in Cupertino are managed by the city,
and the city operates a "Field Status Hotline" at 408-777-3566,
or at https://twitter.com/cupertinofields

We understand that field conditions change
but our procedure is to use the field status at 60 minutes prior
to the start of a game or practice as the final answer for that event
so that everyone has the same chance to make plans.
