First of all,
for the ages we serve,
we recognize that a commited parent enables their children
to be able to make and meet their commitments.

Parents, please be aware of
[our player expectations](/info/players).
We will hold you to the same exectations.

----

Cupertino FC is a volunteer driven organization,
and our parents are the source of our strength.

Our program is based on finding the right opportunity for our players.
Finding these opportunities is much more successful
when our parents step in and engage with their team,
with their coaches, with the club,
and become involved in shaping the environment
to become a good fit for the players.

Be involved with your team.
There is no surer way to ensure your player's success.

[Be involved with your club](/info/board).
There is no better way to help us help you.

----


Finally, 
our club is based on an expectation of good sportsmanship,
and this includes the parents and all our fans.

We believe strongly in respecting the game,
respecting our opponents,
and respecting those who make our games possible.
Disrespect towards a player,
towards a coach or other team participant,
towards a referee or any other official,
is a violation of our expectations
and will not be tolerated.
