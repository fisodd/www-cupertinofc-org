Learn by playing.

We use the game of soccer
to help our players learn
how to compete better on the field,
and in the rest of their life.

----

We are an open organization
dedicated to creating the best environment for our players
based on a commitment to player development and good sportsmanship.

We are dedicated to soccer as a team sport.
We believe that teams do better when everyone plays,
and we believe that players do better with positive coaching.

We build teams opportunistically to compete in the local competitive leagues.
We host open tryouts, seeking the best players that will help each team compete,
as well as the players that will best fit with available positions.
We work to find the right degree of challenge for the talent available.
Like any competitive organization we do not like to lose,
but we see winning every game
as a sign that we missed an opportunity to reach higher.
We measure our success not by our win/loss records,
but by how many of our players continue to play with us season after season.

There are bigger clubs, there are older clubs,
there are clubs with fancier uniforms and flashier players,
but we believe that if you are seeking an enjoyable opportunity
for your player to learn what the game of soccer can teach
about the strength of teamwork and
the confidence from facing challenges,
then Cupertino FC can be the club that helps you grow.
